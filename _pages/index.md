[/vc_column_text][vc_separator type="small" up="20" down="20"][/vc_column][/vc_row][vc_row][vc_column][vc_column_text]In early frontier days the small-town general store was the social hub and lifeline for the hardy pioneers that settled the American Southwest. These stores, or provisioners, sold everything from nails to flour, blankets to whiskey. Arizona, despite efforts to tame her, is still a wild place with many secrets lying just below the surface. The most recent discovery is the propensity for the vine to thrive here and to yield a fine nectar that is indisputably Southwestern. Provisioner wines capture and share the soul of this place, and they do so in the spirit of the old-time general store: they support new exploration, they push us into new territory and make this quest we are on a little more honest and enjoyable. And all of this without breaking the bank. Drink well. <em>These are wines for the people!</em>[/vc_column_text][/vc_column][/vc_row]
